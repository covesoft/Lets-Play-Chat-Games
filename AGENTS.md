# Let’s Play development

This repository implements the New Rules chat game in the Let’s Play application.
Owner-provided design notes may be available privately under `design/`. Consult
them before changing game behavior. Never commit, package, or copy their contents
into public documentation. The public `docs/` directory contains operational
documentation only.

Use Python 3.13. `pyproject.toml` owns dependency pins; update `uv.lock` and both
requirements exports together. Run the application with `python -m lets_play`
or the installed `lets-play` command. Use `CHATGAMES_*` configuration names; there
are no legacy launcher/configuration aliases. No token or external private list
is required for offline tests.

Keep the New Rules domain independent of Discord and storage. Do not treat the
offline parser/contracts or migration bookkeeping as implemented gameplay. Finish M1
interfaces, parser examples, and persistent transaction boundaries before wiring
playable commands. Resolve the relevant open contracts at their designated gates.

Never commit `.env`, production word lists, databases/sidecars, transcripts, or
media. Use harmless fixtures. Do not contact/invite collaborators or deploy the
bot without instructions. Do not run the live bot just to verify an offline edit.

Run meaningful checks for each change:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check .
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m lets_play --check-config
```

For packaging/dependency changes, also run `python -m build` and `python -m pip
check` (or `uv pip check`). Record actual results and remaining limits in the
private implementation notes when available. Never report a mock/offline check
as live Discord or Windows evidence. M1 is authorized in bounded increments.
The owner verified the earlier v0.1.3 shell live. The source-hygiene test uses
binary NUL-framed Git input/output to avoid Windows newline translation. Verify
on Windows/CI before claiming Windows execution evidence for later increments.
